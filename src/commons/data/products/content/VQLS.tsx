          Specifically, if we are given some matrix A, such that Ax = b, where 
b is some known vector, the VQLS algorithm attempts to find x that is proportional to the actual solution. Such an algorithm can be run on near-term devices and recent studies indicate that VQLS has a better 
runtime-scaling (empirically obtained) compared to the classical schemes.

          Many proposed quantum algorithms, including HHL, for solving linear systems of equations cannot be implemented in the near term. For near-term quantum 
computers, a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, VQLS, for solving linear systems was proposed. VQLS is one of the 
popular schemes that demonstrates how variational circuits can be used to solve systems of linear equations.

          Let's make some assumptions first about the form of ùêÄ and ùêõ. The first assumption is that the matrix ùêÄ is Hermitian, A‚ààCN√óN can always be expressed as linear combination of unitaries. We assume that such a decomposition is presented to us. Also, we assume that the vector ùêõ and ci are real numbers and each ùê¥ùëñ is an unitary. Later we discuss, how one can achieve such a decomposition. Also, we assume that the vector
b=(b0,b1,b2,‚ãØ,bN‚àí1) can be loaded to a quantum state |b‚ü©=1‚àëj=0N‚àí1|bi|2‚àëi=0N‚àí1bi|i‚ü© using a suitable unitary U.
